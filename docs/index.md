This page was created as a data resource to anyone working with, or just curious about, the Woburn Massachusetts ground water contamination site featured in the best-selling book "A Civil Action" by Jonathan Harr and the Hollywood movie by the same name. This web site was originally developed as a resource for students in [CE En 647 - Ground Water Modeling](http://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/syllabus/) taught by [Dr. Norm Jones](http://www.emrl.byu.edu/njones/) at [Brigham Young University](http://www.byu.edu). However, anyone is welcome to use the information found here.
