# Welcome!

This page was created as a data resource to anyone working with, or just curious about, the Woburn Massachusetts ground water contamination site featured in the best-selling book "A Civil Action" by Jonathan Harr and the Hollywood movie by the same name. This web site was originally developed as a resource for students in CE En 647 - Ground Water Modeling taught by Dr. Norm Jones at Brigham Young University. However, anyone is welcome to use the information found here.

## **Highlights**

- **Photo Gallery**: Some great photos of the site
- **USGS Plates**: The maps related to the USGS study are now available
- **Complete NUS Report**: The entire NUS report is now online, including all of the plates
