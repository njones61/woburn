# USGS Study

## US Geological Survey Study

The USGS conducted an extensive study of the Woburn site and built a MODFLOW model of the flow system in the Aberjona aquifer.

## Reports

The following are official USGS reports describing the investigation and the model:

- **[Area of Influence and Zone of Contribution](reports/USGS area of influence.pdf)** to Superfund-Site Wells G and H, Woburn, Massachusetts
- **[Hydrogeology and Simulation of Ground-Water Flow](reports/USGS simulation of GW flow.pdf)** at Superfund-Site Wells G and H, Woburn, Massachusetts

## USGS Plates

The following maps are also available. These are very large files in TIFF format so the best approach is to right-click and save the files to your computer before opening them for viewing.

- **[Plate 1. Altitude of water table, 12/4/85](plates/Plate 1. Altitude of water table, 12.4.85.pdf)**
- **[Plate 2. Potentiometric surface in deep strata, 12/4/85](plates/usgs_plate_2.tif)**
- **[Plate 3. Drawdown after 30 days of pump test, 1/3/86](plates/usgs_plate_3.tif)**
- **[Plate 4. Drawdown in deep strata after 30 days of pump test, 1/3/86](plates/usgs_plate_4.tif)**
- **[Plate 5. Water table after 30 days of pump test, 1/3/86](plates/usgs_plate_5.tif)**
- **[Plate 6. Potentiometric surface in deep strata, 1/3/86](plates/usgs_plate_6.tif)**

## Model

The following is the MODFLOW model built by the USGS. Copy the zip file to a directory and unzip.

- **[model.zip](model/model.zip)** (native files - MODFLOW 2000)
- **[model_gms.zip](model/model_gms.zip)** (GMS-compatible version - MODFLOW 2000)
