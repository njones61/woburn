<p>Wells G &amp; H were developed by the City of Woburn in 1964 and 1967,  respectively, in response to urban growth during the 1960's.  The wells, screened in  the Aberjona aquifer, were capable of supplying two million gallons of water per day, but  were initially intended only for use during times of water shortage or emergencies.    Local officials estimate that 27-28% of the community's water supply was provided by Wells  G &amp; H.  The remainder of the water supply was provided by seven wells located  near Horn Pond south of Salem Street.  These wells are located in a different aquifer  and are not affected by contamination present in the study area of Wells G &amp; H.   Local records indicate that the water from Wells G &amp; H exhibited high concentrations  of manganese and iron, which resulted in unpleasant taste and odor.   Prompted by  citizens' complaints concerning water quality, and in order to meet anticipated increased  demand for water, the City of Woburn examined the feasibility of treating the water in  1974 (NUS, 1985).  However, treatment was not implemented.</p>
<p>On May 4, 1979, 184 55-gallon drums containing polyurethane and toluene  diisocyanate were found on a vacant lot located on Mishawum Road on property owned by the  Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA).  The drums were removed by unknown  parties during negotiations with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality  Engineering (DEQE) over removal of these drums.  This incident prompted DEQE to  sample the nearest down gradient water supply, Woburn's municipal water supply from Wells  G &amp; H, as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Several chlorinated volatile organic compounds were detected by DEQE in  water from Wells G &amp; H at concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 part per billion (ppb).    Wells G &amp; H were subsequently shut down on May 21, 1979, forcing the City of  Woburn to use Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) water to supplement its public water  supply.  Currently, the MDC supplies approximately one third of the city's water  needs.  </p>
<p>During the mid to late 1970's, the local community became concerned over  the incidence of childhood leukemia, particularly in the Pine Street area of east Woburn.    After DEQE detected volatile organic contamination in Wells G &amp; H in 1979, some  members of the local community suspected that the incidence of leukemia was linked to the  possible exposure to volatile organic chemicals through the Wells G &amp; H water supply.    The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) began investigating the  problem in December, 1979.  A higher than expected rate of childhood leukemia was  confirmed by the MDPH in April, 1980.</p>
<p>Upgradient of Wells G &amp; H, another area of waste disposal (the  Industriplex site) came to the attention of local, state, and federal officials in the  1970's, when the owner began developing a portion of the site (Ecology and Environment,  1982b).  Filling and excavating activities created noxious odors which prompted  citizen complaints.</p>
<p>Soils contaminated with heavy metals and arsenic exist on the  Industriplex site.  Volatile organic contamination has been found in the groundwater  beneath the site (Roux, 1983a).</p>
<p>In May, 1983 three administrative orders pursuant to Section 3013 of the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) were issued to W.R. Grace and Co., Inc.  (Cryovac Division), UniFirst Corporation (formerly Interstate Uniform Services  Corporation), and Beatrice Foods, Inc..  These orders required submittal of proposals  by each company for the sampling, analysis, monitoring, and reporting that would address  the problem of possible groundwater contamination on or emanating from their properties.    Groundwater monitoring programs were subsequently initiated by the three companies.</p>
<p>In 1989, EPA directed Camp, Dresser, &amp; McKee (CDM) to prepare a  Remedial Action Master Plan (RAMP) for Wells G &amp; H site.  The RAMP's purpose was  &quot;to identify the type, scope and sequence of activities to identify and implement a  remedial action(s) to mitigate the effects of the contaminants in East Woburn&quot; (Camp,  Dresser, &amp; McKee, 1983).</p>
<p>In May, 1982, a number of citizens whose children had developed leukemia  filed a civil lawsuit against two companies (W.R. Grace/Cryovac Division and Beatrice  Foods) suspected of contributing contamination to Wells G &amp; H.  In April, 1985,  the same citizen's group brought civil lawsuits against a third company: Unifirst  Corporation.  The civil lawsuits brought against the first two companies in 1982 was  recently settled out of court following part of what was planned as a three part trial.    The civil lawsuit filed against UniFirst Corporation was settled out of court in  October, 1985.</p>
