## GeoTrans Analysis

HSI GeoTrans was one of the companies that studied the Woburn site for the trial. This is a newsletter describing the project and some of its findings. This is only a brief overview and little actual test data are given, but you may find it interesting.

We would like to thank Jack Guswa for making this newsletter available.
